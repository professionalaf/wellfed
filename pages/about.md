## Our Story

WellFed was founded by former Federal employees who understood firsthand the challenges of transitioning from government service to the private sector. What began as an informal support network has grown into a comprehensive organization dedicated to empowering Federal workers navigating career transitions.

## Our Mission

We believe that public servants deserve support when their government careers end or change. Our mission is to provide Federal workers who have lost their jobs or are transitioning to the private sector with the resources, training, and community they need to successfully navigate their next professional chapter.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where the valuable skills and experience of Federal workers are recognized and leveraged in the private sector. We're working toward a future where the transition between government and private employment is smooth, supportive, and empowering.

## Our Team

WellFed is powered by a dedicated team of former Federal employees, career coaches, HR professionals, and private sector partners who understand both worlds and can help bridge the gap.
