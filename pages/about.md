## Our Story

WellFed was founded in 2020 with a simple mission: to ensure that everyone in our community has access to nutritious, delicious meals that support their health and wellbeing. What began as a small initiative to deliver healthy meals to new parents has grown into a comprehensive organization that serves people at every stage of life.

## Our Mission

We believe that good nutrition is the foundation of a healthy, fulfilling life. Our mission is to nourish our community through thoughtfully prepared meals and evidence-based nutrition education, making healthy eating accessible, enjoyable, and sustainable for everyone.

## Our Vision

We envision a community where everyone has the resources and knowledge they need to nourish themselves and their families well, regardless of their circumstances. We're working toward a future where good food is seen as a basic right, not a privilege.

## Our Team

WellFed is powered by a dedicated team of culinary professionals, nutrition experts, volunteers, and community partners who share our passion for food and wellbeing.
