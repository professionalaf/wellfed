WellFed is proud to celebrate the incredible partnerships that make our work possible. From local farms to community organizations, these collaborations enable us to reach more people and have a greater impact.

## Farm Partners

Our relationship with local farmers ensures that our meals contain the freshest, most nutritious ingredients possible. This growing season, we've worked with:

- Green Valley Farms
- Sunshine Organics
- Heritage Family Farm
- Urban Roots Community Garden

These partnerships not only support our mission but also strengthen the local food economy and reduce our environmental footprint.

## Community Organizations

We're grateful for our partnerships with these community organizations:

- Metro Food Bank
- Senior Services Center
- Family Resource Network
- Downtown Health Clinic

Through these collaborations, we're able to identify and serve those most in need of nutritional support in our community.

## Volunteer Spotlight

We'd also like to recognize our dedicated volunteers who contribute their time and talents to our mission. This month, we're spotlighting Maria Rodriguez, who has volunteered over 100 hours in our community kitchen this year.

"Volunteering with WellFed gives me the opportunity to share my love of cooking while making a real difference in people's lives," says Maria. "It's the highlight of my week."
